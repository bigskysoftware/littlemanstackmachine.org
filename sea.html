    <h1>Sea: A <em>Relatively</em> High-Level Functional Language</h1>

    <p>
        A design goal of the LMSM is to provide <em>just</em> enough infrastructure such that a small,
        <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/High-level_programming_language"> high-level programming language </a>
        can be built for it relatively easily.  This page describes a language called "Sea" that is built on top of the
        LMSM. Compared to a non-stack-based language like Firth, Sea is not as simple to implement in the LMSM.
    </p>

    <p>In today's world, it seems like 9 out of every 10 of languages that are widely used are based on the C programming language.</p>

    <p>
        The (second) programming language for the LMSM is called "Sea", which is, to an extent, based on the
        <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/C_(programming_language)">C</a> programming language. Similar to
        C, Sea mainly uses a tree-like style of syntax. The stack is often hidden from the programmer, but expressions
        are compiled down into stack-instructions.
    </p>

    <p>
        It is recommended that a Sea compiler is provided with implementations of the LMSM, to show how a high-level
        programming language can compile down to LMSM assembly.
    </p>

    <h2>An Example Sea Program: Squaring A Number</h2>

    <p>
        Before we delve into the details of Sea, let's look at an example program, based on the <code>SQUARE</code>
        assembly program we looked at on the <a href="assembly.html">LMSM Assembly</a> page.  The Sea program
        that would compile down to this assembly looks like this:
    </p>

    <pre>
    extern int get();

    int main() {
        int x = get();
        return square(x);
    }

    int square(int x) {
        return x * x;
    }
    </pre>

    <p>
        The <code>extern int get();</code> line tells the Sea compiler that the <code>get</code> function is
        an external function defined internally by the compiler (or externally from the code).
    </p>

    <p>
        Like most simple C programs, Sea programs require a main function. The main function can return either
        an int or void&mdash;the difference being that the returned int gets printed to the output console whereas void does not.
    </p>

    <p>
        The first line in the main function <code>int x = get();</code> declares a variable named <code>x</code> and
        gives it a value of <code>get()</code>.  The <code>get()</code> function is a built-in function that reads
        a value from the input console.
    </p>

    <p>
        The square function is defined in the same way as the main function, except that it takes an argument.
        The <code>return x * x;</code> line returns the square of the argument.
    </p>

    <p>
        Finally, the <code>return square(x);</code> line in the main function returns the square of the value
        read from the input console. Since the main function returns an int, the squared value is printed to the
        output console.
    </p>

    <p>
        An alternative way to print the value would be to declare the <code>extern void put(int);</code> function
        and then call <code>put(square(x));</code> instead of <code>return square(x);</code>.
    </p>

    <p>
        So that's a quick introduction to the SAea programming language. Now let's look at all the elements of
        the language in more detail.
    </p>

    <h2>Elements Of The Sea Programming Langauge</h2>

    <p>
        The Sea programming language consists of a set of <em>elements</em>.  Calling them "expressions" or "statements"
        in the traditional sense of those terms is a little misleading since values are stored on a stack, so we will
        stick with the term "element".
    </p>

    <h3>Basic Elements</h3>

    <p>Sea supports the following "basic" elements:</p>

    <table style="width: 100%">

            </td>
        </tr>
        </tbody>
    </table>

    <h3>Statements Elements</h3>

    <p>Sea supports the following statements to perform more high-level operations</p>

    <table style="width: 100%">
        <thead>
        <tr>
            <th>
                Element
            </th>
            <th>

            </th>
            <th>

            </th>
        </tr>
        </thead>
        <tbody>
        <tr>
            <td>
                Return (void)
            </td>
            <td>
                <code>return;</code>
            </td>
            <td>
                <code>RET</code>
            </td>
        </tr>
        <tr>
            <td>
                Return (int)
            </td>
            <td>
                <code>return 1;</code>
            </td>
            <td>
                <code>SPUSHI 1 RET</code>
            </td>
        </tr>
        <tr>
            <td>
                Assignment
            </td>
            <td>
                <code>x = 1;</code>
            </td>
            <td>
                <code>SPUSHI 1 LDI 0 FST</code>
            </td>
        </tr>
        <tr>
            <td>
                Function Call
            </td>
            <td>
                <code>sum2(0, 0);</code>
            </td>
            <td>
                <code>SPUSHI 0 SPUSHI 0 SPUSHI 2 CALL put</code>
            </td>
        </tr>
        </tbody>
    </table>

    <h3>Variables</h3>

    <p>
        Variables are a weird concept in a non-stack based language. In Sea, variables can live in functions for a lifetime
    smaller than that of the entire program. As a result, variables are stored in the header of the function.
    </p>

    <p>
        What is a function header you ask? It is a span of contiguous memory near the return-address of the function. It
        looks something like this:
    </p>

    <pre>| ...vars... | frame-size | post-return-instruction |</pre>
    <p>
        The frame-size is the number of bytes that the function header takes up. The post-return-instruction is the
        instruction that is executed after the function returns. Arguments to a function are also stored here. The downside
        to this approach is you have to know <em>exactly</em> how many variables you have at compile-time.
    </p>

    <p>
        Let's consider the following function
    </p>

    <pre>
    int squareSum(int n) {
        int sum = 0;
        for (int i = 0; i < n; i = i + 1) {
            sum = sum + i * i;
        }
        return sum;
    }
    </pre>

    <p>
        This function has 1 argument, and two local variables. This means that the frame-size of its header will be 3.
        The function header will look like this:
    </p>

    <pre>| i | sum | n | 3 | ... |</pre>

    <h3>The For-Statement</h3>
    <p>
        The for-statement is a special statement that allows you to loop over a block of code a fixed number of times.
        The for-statement has the following syntax:
    </p>
    <code>
        for (int i = 0; i < 5; i = i + 1) { ...body }
    </code>

    <p>The for-statement really has four parts: a declaration, a continuation, an incrementation, and a body.  The first
        three of these four parts are completely optional. An infinite loop can be formed like this: <code>for (;;) {}
        </code></p>
    <p></p>

    <p>
        The declaration can either be any expression or a variable declaration:
        <code>
            int var = 0;
        </code>
        or
        <code>
            var = 0;
        </code>
    </p>

    <p>
        The continuation can be any expression that evaluates to an integer value.
        <code>i < 5;</code>
    </p>

    <p>
        The incrementation can be any expression that evaluates to an integer value.
        <code>i = i + 1;</code>
    </p>

    <p>
        The body can be any block of code or a single statement.
    </p>

    <h3>The While Statement</h3>
    <p>
        The while-statement is a special statement that allows you to loop over a block of code until a condition is met.
        The while-statement has the following syntax:
    </p>
    <code>
        while (i < 5) { ...body }
    </code>

    <p>
        The while-statement has two parts: a continuation, and a body. The continuation is required.
        An infinite loop can be formed like this: <code>while (1) {}</code>
    </p>

    <p>
        The continuation can be any expression that evaluates to an integer value.
        <code>i < 5;</code>
    </p>

    <h3>The If-Else Statement</h3>

    <p>
        The if-else statement is a special statement that allows you to conditionally execute a block of code. The
        if-else statement has the following syntax:
    </p>

    <code>
        if (i < 5) { ...body } else { ...body }
    </code>

    <p>
        The if-else statement has three parts: a continuation, a body, and an else-body. The continuation is required.
        The else-body is optional. The else-body is executed if the continuation evaluates to false.
    </p>

    <p>
        The continuation can be any expression that evaluates to an integer value.
        <code>i < 5;</code>
    </p>

    <p>Both the if-body and the else-body can either be a block or a single statement</p>

    <h3>I/O</h3>

    <p>Sea supports the following elements for IO:</p>

    <table style="width: 100%">
        <thead>
        <tr>
            <th>
                Element
            </th>
            <th>
                Example
            </th>
            <th>
                Assembly
            </th>
        </tr>
        </thead>
        <tbody>
        <tr>
            <td>
                Get
            </td>
            <td>
                <code>get(); <em>FROM</em> extern int get();</code>
            </td>
            <td>
                <code>INP SPUSH</code>
            </td>
        </tr>
        <tr>
            <td>
                Print
            </td>
            <td>
                <code>put(1); <em>FROM</em> extern void put(int);</code>
            </td>
            <td>
                <code>LDI 1 OUT</code>
            </td>
        </tr>
        </tbody>
    </table>


    <h3>Global Variables</h3>

    <p>
        Sea supports global variables.  They can be declared like any other variable in Sea, but must be declared
        outside of a function.
    </p>

    <code>
        int x;
    </code>

    <p>Variables can be declared at the top-level in Sea programs, and are global. They cannot be declared within functions,
        loops or conditionals. Variables cannot be used before they are declared</p>

    <h3>Functions</h3>

    <p>
        Functions can be declared using the traditional C syntax. A return type followed by a function name followed by
        an parameter list. The parameter list is a comma separated list of types and names.  The function body is
        enclosed in curly braces.
    </p>

    <pre>
    int square(int n) {
        return n * n;
    }
    </pre>

    <p>
        Functions can return to a caller by using the <code>return</code> element. The return element is required to
        have a value on the stack. The value on the stack will be returned to the caller.
    </p>

    <p>
        Note that functions in Sea can call themselves recursively.
    </p>

    <h2>Fibbonacci.sea</h2>

    <p>
        Below is a recursive implementation of the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fibonacci_number">fibonacci</a>

    <pre>
extern int get();
extern void put(int);

int main() {
  int in, num;
  in = get();
  num = fib(in);
  put(num);
  return in;
}

int fib(int n) {
  if (n < 2) return 1;
  return fib(n - 1) + fib(n - 2);
}
    </pre>
    <h2>Fibbonacci_Iter.sea</h2>

    <p>
        Below is an iterative implementation of the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fibonacci_number">fibonacci</a>
        algorithm in Sea:

    int in = get();

    int num = 1;
    for (int a = 1; in > 1; in = in - 1) {
        int tmp = a;
        a = num;
        num = tmp + num;
    }
    put(num);

    return 0;
}
     </pre>
