    <h1>The LMSM Instruction Cycle</h1>
    <p>
        As a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Von_Neumann_architecture">Von Neumann</a> machine, the
        LMSM follows a simple <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Instruction_cycle">Instruction Cycle</a>,
        identical to the instruction cycle of the LMC:
    </p>

    <ol>
        <li>
            The value in the memory location pointed to by the <code>program_counter</code> register is retrieved
            from memory and placed in the <code>current_instruction</code> register.
        </li>
        <li>
            The program counter is incremented by one.
        </li>
        <li>
            The instruction is executed.
        </li>
        <li>
            The cycle is repeated.
        </li>
    </ol>

    <p>
        This simple loop is the basis for computation on the LMSM and, in a broad sense, of many of the computers
        we use today.
    </p>

    <p>
        Instructions, when executed, update the state of the computer in some manner: moving a value between memory
        locations and registers, updating registers, outputing data, etc.
    </p>

    <h2>Example Execution</h2>

    <p>
        In order to understand how execution works, let's step through a cycle of execution in detail. Consider an
        LMSM whose <code>program_counter</code> is set to 0 and who has the following numeric values
        in the first three slots in memory:
    </p>

    <img src="img/execution1.png">

    <h3>Cycle 1</h3>

    <p>
        Execution would begin by retrieving instruction from memory slot 0, which is where the
        <code>program_counter</code>
        initially points to and placing it in the <code>current_instruction</code> register:
    </p>

    <img src="img/execution2.png">

    <p>
        Next, the <code>program_counter</code> value is incremented from 0 to 1, so that it points to the next
        instruction
        in memory:
    </p>

    <img src="img/execution3.png">

    <p>
        Next, the instruction is executed. In this case, the instruction is 401, which tells the
        LMSM to place the value 1 into the <code>accumulator</code> register.
        (We will go over exactly what each instruction means in the next section.)
    </p>

    <img src="img/execution4.png">

    <p>
        This completes a single instruction cycle for the LMSM. The LMSM then starts again from the beginning of
        the cycle and repeats the same logic.
    </p>

    <h3>Cycle 2</h3>

    <p>
        This time the <code>program_counter</code> is pointing to slot 1, so the instruction 902 is loaded into the
        <code>current_instruction</code> register and the <code>program_counter</code> is incremented to the value 2.
        The 902 instruction tells the LMSM to print the current value of the <code>accumulator</code> register to
        output.
    </p>

    <p>
        Once again, the cycle repeats.
    </p>

    <h3>Cycle 3</h3>

    <p>
        Now the <code>program_counter</code> is pointing to slot 2, so the instruction 000 is loaded into the
        <code>current_instruction</code> register and the <code>program_counter</code> is incremented to the value 3.
    </p>

    <p>
        The 000 instruction tells the LMSM to halt, and so it stops executing.
    </p>

    <h3>A Completed Program!</h3>

    <p>
        The program above prints the number 1 to output. It might not look like much, but this is the "Hello World" of
        LMSM, and it demonstrates the basic operation mechanics of the system.
    </p>

    <h1>LMSM Instructions</h1>

    <p>
        In the program above we executed LMSM machine instructions to achieve something. In this section we will
        go over all the instructions available and what they do.
    </p>

    <p>
        The first thing to bear in mind is that LMSM instructions are stored in LMSM memory as "regular" data. There is
        no distinction between "instructions" and "data". Just like any other piece of data in the LMSM, instructions
        are numeric values between -999 and 999.
    </p>

    <p>
        Let's look at the available instructions.
    </p>

    <h2>LMC Instructions</h2>

    <p>
        The LMSM supports the following instructions, which are all taken, unchanged, from the LCM:

    <p>
        Because the LMSM supports all these instructions, a LMC program will execute on the LMSM. The LMSM is
        <em>backwards compatible</em> with the LMC, which is a very common situation in CPU evolution: as CPUs
        developed, old code often continued to work on the new CPUs.
    </p>

    <h2>The "Load Immediate" Instruction</h2>

    <p>
        In addition to these standard LMC instructions, the LMSM also supports two new "standard" instructions:
    </p>

    <ul>
        <li>
            An "immediate" instruction to load a value directly into the accumulator (We saw this instruction in our simple "Hello World" program)
        </li>
        <li>
            A "noop" instruction that makes code generation in the Firth compiler easier
        </li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Stack Instructions</h2>

    <p>
        The most significant addition to the LMC model in the LMSM is the addition of several instructions for
        working with the new stacks available in upper memory:

    <h2>Assembly Instruction Examples</h2>

    <p>
        Let's look at the mechanics for a few instructions on the LMSM to get a feel for how things work.
    </p>

    <h3>The <code>ADD</code> Instruction</h3>

    <p>
        The <code>ADD</code> assembly instruction takes a two digit argument and tells the LMSM to add the value
        at that memory location to the accumulator.
    </p>

    <p>
        Consider the assembly <code>ADD 10</code>. This would assemble down to the machine instruction <code>110</code>.
    </p>

    <p>
        If this instruction were loaded into memory and ready to execute, the LSMS would look like this:
    </p>

    <img src="img/add1.png">

    <p>
        Note that the program counter is pointing to the instruction after the <code>ADD</code> machine instruction,
        and the <code>ADD</code> machine instruction has been loaded into current instruction register.  The LMSM
        is ready to execute the instruction and continue.
    </p>

    <p>
        Note also that the value stored in memory location <code>10</code> is the value <code>20</code>, and that
        the accumulator currently has the value <code>22</code>.
    </p>


    <img src="img/add2.png">

    <p>
        Once the instruction has executed the value <code>20</code> has been added to the accumulator, giving the
        value <code>42</code>.
    </p>

    <p>
        The LMSM then moves on to the next instruction.
    </p>

    <h3>The <code>BRZ</code> Instruction</h3>

    <p>
        The <code>BRZ</code> assembly instruction takes a two digit argument and tells the LMSM to "jump" to that
        memory location if the accumulator is zero.  This is an example of assembly control flow, allowing the
        LMSM to conditionally execute code depending on the state of data.
    </p>

    <p>
        Consider the assembly <code>BRZ 10</code>. This would assemble down to the machine instruction <code>710</code>.
    </p>

    <p>
        If this instruction were loaded into memory and ready to execute, the LSMS would look like this:
    </p>

    <img src="img/brz1.png">

    <p>
        Note that the program counter is pointing to the instruction after the <code>BRZ</code> machine instruction,
        and the <code>BRZ</code> machine instruction has been loaded into current instruction register.
    </p>

    <p>
        The accumulator currently has the value <code>0</code>, so the condition to make the jump is true.
    </p>


    <img src="img/brz2.png">

    <p>
        Once the instruction has executed, because the accumulator had the value 0, the program counter has been updated
        to point to the instruction at memory position <code>10</code>, which has the value <code>000</code>.
    </p>

    <p>
        The value <code>000</code> tells the LMSM to halt, so this <code>BRZ</code> instruction is effectively telling
        the LSMS: "Stop executing if the accumulator is zero."
    </p>

    <h3>The <code>SPUSH</code> Instruction</h3>

    <p>
        The next instruction we are going to look at is the <code>SPUSH</code> instruction, which takes the current
        value of the accumulator and "pushes" it onto the top of the value stack.
    </p>

    <p>
        Note that the stack pointer starts with the value <code>200</code>, indicating that there are no values
        on the stack, and that the accumulator starts with the value 22.  This latter value will be the value
        "pushed" onto the stack.
    </p>

    <img src="img/spush1.png">

    <p>
        The first step in the push operation is to decrement the stack pointer register by <code>1</code> to
        <code>199</code>.  This will be the memory location that the LMSM stores the value into.
    </p>

    <img src="img/spush2.png">

    <p>
        The second step in the push operation is to move the value of the accumulator into the memory location that
        the stack pointer points to.
    </p>

    <img src="img/spush3.png">

    <p>
        At this point, the LMSM is done: the value 22 has been "pushed" onto the top of the value stack.  If another
        <code>SPUSH</code> were to occur, the new value would be located in the next slot down from this, effectively
        "growing" the value stack downwards.
    </p>

    <h3>The <code>SADD</code> Instruction</h3>

    <p>
        The final instruction we are going to look at is the <code>SADD</code> instruction, which adds the top two
        values on the value stack together and replaces them with the result.
    </p>

    <p>
        Note that in this case the stack pointer starts with the value <code>198</code>, and that there are two values
        on the stack, <code>5</code> and <code>8</code>, with <code>8</code> being on the top of the stack.
    </p>

    <img src="img/sadd1.png">

    <p>
        The first step in execution is to add the two values together, producing the value <code>13</code> and placing
        it in the slot just above the current stack pointer.
    </p>

    <img src="img/sadd2.png">

    <p>
        The next step in execution is to increment the stack pointer to <code>199</code>.  This step effectively drops
        the top value <code>8</code> from the stack, leaving <code>13</code>, the result of the addition, at the top
        of the stack.
    </p>

    <p>
        Note also that the <code>8</code> value is not zero'd out: it is no longer relevant since the stack pointer
        is "above" (or, if you like, "below" it).
    </p>

    <img src="img/sadd3.png">

    <p>
        At this point, the LMSM is done with this instruction: the top two values have been "popped" off the stack, added
        and the result has been "pushed" onto it.
    </p>

    <h2><code>DAT</code> Assembly Instructions</h2>

    <p>
        The <code>DAT</code> assembly instruction tells the LMSM assembler: "Put the value following me directly into
        the memory spot I correspond with.
    </p>

    <p>
        Consider the following LMSM Assembly program:
    </p>

    <img src="img/dat1.png"/>

    <p>
        The <code>DAT</code> assembly instruction tells the assembler to place the raw value <code>1</code> into the
        memory location that the instruction corresponds to.  In this case, the value <code>1</code> is placed in
        memory location <code>4</code>, since that is the memory slot that corresponds with the <code>DAT</code>
        assembly instruction.
    </p>

    <p>
        The <code>DAT</code> assembly instruction lets programmers save numbers in memory for use in their programs.  In
        this case, the program asks the user for input, adds the value 1 to it (even though the second instruction
        reads <code>ADD 4</code>, remember that means "Add the value in <em>memory location</em> 4 to the accumulator")
        and then outputs the result.
    </p>

    <h2>Labels</h2>

    <p>
        Labels are a feature of LMSM that let programmers use symbolic, rather than absolute, locations when writing
        assembly.  In the previous example, the <code>ADD</code> instruction had a hard-coded reference to memory location
        <code>4</code>.
    </p>

    <p>
       But what if we added another instruction, say another <code>ADD</code>, to add the number twice:
    </p>

    <img src="img/label1.png"/>

    <p>
        Now we are in a bad spot!  The <code>ADD 4</code> instructions reference memory location <code>4</code>, but that
        holds the <code>HLT</code> instruction, which has the value <code>0</code>.  So we are now inadvertently adding
        the value <code>0</code> to the accumulator twice!
    </p>

    <p>
        We could fix this by updating the two instructions to be <code>ADD 5</code>, but it would get annoying if, every
        time we changed the program, we had to go back and edit all these instructions.  What would be better is if
        we could give a particular instruction a <em>symbolic name</em> and then let the assembler figure out the
        location that the instruction ends up at.
    </p>

    <p>
        This is exactly what labels give us.  Any assembly instruction, including <code>DAT</code> instructions,
        can be labeled with a prefix, and then referred to by other instructions via that prefix.
    </p>

    <p>
        Let's give the <code>DAT</code> instruction the label <code>ONE</code>, since it holds the value <code>1</code>
        for use in our program:
    </p>

    <img src="img/label2.png"/>

    <p>
        We prefix the <code>DAT</code> instruction with the label <code>ONE</code> and then update the <code>ADD</code>
        instructions to refer to that label, rather than fixed positions in memory.  Now the assembler goes through
        the trouble of figuring exactly where the value <code>1</code> ends up in memory, and generates the correct
        machine instructions for the <code>ADD</code> assembly instructions.
    </p>

    <p>
        Much nicer!
    </p>

    <h2>Pseudo-Instructions</h2>

    <p>
        In addition to the "real" assembly instructions above, LMSM assembly supports two "pseudo-instructions".
        Pseudo-instructions are assembly instructions that are valid assembly, but that do not correspond directly
        to a single machine instruction.
    </p>

    <p>
        Pseudo-instructions are included in the LMSM to make assembly programming more convenient and because they
        are common in other more realistic assembly languages, particularly
        <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Reduced_instruction_set_computer">RISC-based</a> languages like
        <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/MIPS_architecture">MIPS</a>.
    </p>

        <tr>
            <th>Pseudo-Instruction</th>
            <th>Assembly Instructions</th>

    </table>

    <h2>Loops & Conditionals In LMSM</h2>

    <p>
        To understand how loops and conditionals work in LMSM, let's look at a classic LMC program that asks a user
        for input and then counts down:
    </p>

    <pre>
    INP
    OUT
    LOOP BRZ QUIT
    SUB ONE
    OUT
    BRA LOOP
    QUIT HLT
    ONE DAT 1
    </pre>

    <p>
        Here is each line explained:
    </p>

    <ul>
        <li>
            Line 1 asks the user to enter a number and saves it in the accumulator
        </li>
        <li>
            Line 2 prints that number out.
        </li>
        <li>
            Line 3 is labeled <code>LOOP</code> and jumps (or branches) to the location labeled <code>QUIT</code>
            if the accumulator is <code>0</code>
        </li>
        <li>
            Line 4 subtracts the value stored in the memory location labeled <code>ONE</code> from the accumulator.
        </li>
        <li>
            Line 5 prints the accumulator out.
        </li>
        <li>
            Line 6 unconditionally jumps back to the instruction on line 3, labled <code>LOOP</code>
        </li>
        <li>
            Line 7 is labeled <code>QUIT</code> and halts the machine
        </li>
        <li>
            Line 8 is labeled <code>ONE</code> and holds the raw value <code>1</code>
        </li>
    </ul>

    <p>
        So, this program will ask the user for a number and then print out a count-down from that number to
        <code>0</code>.  The conditional branch on line 3 gives us the conditional, akin to an <code>if</code>
        statement in a higher level programming language.  The unconditional branch on line 6 is what makes the
        code "loop".
    </p>

    <h2>Function Calls</h2>

    <p>
        The last major bit of functionality to understand about the LMSM is how function calls work.  This topic
        is sufficiently complicated and important as to deserve its own section, which you can find <a href="functions.html">here</a>.
