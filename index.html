    <h1>Introduction</h1>
    <p>
        The Little Man Stack Machine (LMSM) is a backwards-compatible extension of the venerable and excellent
        <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Little_man_computer">Little Man Computer</a> (LMC) teaching computer model.
        It is designed to be a teaching aid, to show people how various aspects of computing work in an easy and approachable
        manner:
    </p>

    <ul>
        <li>The operations of a basic Von-Neumann style computer</li>
        <li>How assembly works</li>
        <li>How assembly can be converted to machine code</li>
        <li>How function calls can be implemented using basic hardware</li>
        <li>How recursive function calls work</li>
        <li>How stack-based languages work</li>
        <li>How a high-level programming language can be compiled to assembly</li>
    </ul>

    <p>
        The LMSM is simple enough that someone interested should be able to build an LMSM emulator,
        an assembler and a compiler from a high-level language to assembly in a short amount of time, such as
        within a single quarter or semester.
    </p>

    <p>
        Like the LMC, the LMSM models a simple <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Von_Neumann_architecture">Von
        Neumann</a> computing machine and the execution cycle is identical to the LMC.  In order to better support
        more computer topics that the LMC the LMSM adds the following functionality:
    </p>

    <ul>
        <li>
            The memory space of the LMSM is doubled from 100 slots to 200 slots.
        </li>
        <li>
            Two new registers are available:
            <ul>
                <li>
                    The <code>stack pointer</code> register that points to the top of the <em>value stack</em>.
                </li>
                <li>
                    The <code>return address pointer</code> register that points to the top of the <em>return address
                    stack</em>.
                </li>
            </ul>
        </li>
        <li>
            A new <code>LDI</code> <a href="https://en.wikichip.org/wiki/immediate_value">"immediate"</a> instruction
            is added for loading immediate values directly into the accumulator.
        </li>
        <li>
            A new set of stack-related instructions are available for working with the two stacks available on the
            LMSM
        </li>
        <li>
            Two "virtual" assembly instructions are available to make assembly coding on the LMSM a bit more pleasant.
        </li>
    </ul>

    <h2>System Diagram</h2>

    <p>
        Below is a system diagram of the LMSM:
    </p>

    <img src="img/lmsm_architecture.png">

    <h3>Overall System Description</h3>

    <p>
        Like the LMC, the LMSM works only in terms of integers between the values -999 and 999.  These integers can
        be interpreted as either data or as instructions, depending on the context they are used in.  The LMSM
        follows a simple <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Von_Neumann_architecture">Von Neumann</a> style
        <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Instruction_cycle">Instruction Cycle</a>: it loads an instruction from
        memory, bumps the program counter, executes the instruction and then repeats.
    </p>

    <p>
        More detail on the execution cycle can be found on the <a href="assembly.html">Assembly & Execution</a> page.
    </p>

    <h3>Registers</h3>

    <p>
        The LMSM has a total of five registers (two more than the LMC).  The registers are as follows:
    </p>

    <ul>
        <li>
            The <code>program_counter</code> register - a register that points to memory location of the next instruction to execute.
            This register starts with the value 0.
        </li>
        <li>
            The <code>accumulator</code> register - a register that is used to "accumulate" values by, for example, an instruction
            adding a value in memory to the value already in the accumulator.  This register starts at value 0.
        </li>
        <li>
            The <code>current_instruction</code> register - a register that holds the currently executing instruction.
            This register starts at value 0.
        </li>
        <li>
            The <code>stack_pointer</code> register - a register that points to the memory location at the "top" of the
            value stack.  This pointer starts at value 200 (meaning no stack exists) and is <em>decremented</em> as the
            value stack grows.
        </li>
        <li>
            The <code>return_address_pointer</code> register - a register that points to the memory location at the "top" of the
            return address stack.  This pointer starts at value 99 (meaning no the return address stack is empty) and it
            is <em>incremented</em> as the value stack grows.
        </li>
    </ul>

    <h3>Memory</h3>
    <p>
        The LMSM has a total of 200 memory slots, double that of the LCM.  The memory is split into two sections: "lower"
        and "upper" segments. Traditional LMC instructions such as <code>ADD</code> operate on the lower memory segment,
        while the LMSM new stack instructions operate on the upper section of memory.
    </p>

    <h2>The Stacks & Function Calls</h2>

    <p>
        A major goal of the LMSM is to provide good hardware infrastructure for implementing
        <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Function_(computer_programming)">function calls</a> so that students
        can see how the function call abstraction can be implemented on top of raw registers and memory. The function
        invocation mechanism in the LMSM is simple but it demonstrates the core concept of using a stack and it
        allows for recursive function calls.
    </p>

    <p>
        See <a href="functions.html">Functions</a> for a detailed look at function calls on the LMSM.
    </p>

    <h2>Firth</h2>

    <p>
        While the LMC is a good for introducing students to how assembly and low level computation works, it
        does not provide enough infrastructure for creating a high-level programming language.
    </p>

    <p>
        By offering a more sophisticated CPU model the LMSM makes it possible to create a simple
        <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Forth_(programming_language)">Forth</a>-inspired language in a relatively
        short amount of time.  This "high-level" language can compile down to LSMS assembly code fairly easily and it
        includes functions, loops, conditionals and so forth: the basics of high-level programming.
    </p>

    <p>
        See <a href="firth.html">Firth</a> for more information on this language.
