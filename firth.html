    <h1>Firth: A High Level Stack Oriented Language</h1>

    <p>
        A design goal of the LMSM is to provide <em>just</em> enough infrastructure such that a small,
        <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/High-level_programming_language"> high-level programming language </a>
        can be built for it relatively easily.  Because of the stack instructions that the LMSM adds to the LMC,
        a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stack-oriented_programming">stack-oriented</a> programming
        language makes the most sense.
    </p>

    <p>Stack languages are not popular today, but in the past there was a lot of interest in them, and they provide
    an interesting, alternative way to think about programming.</p>

    <p>
        The programming language for the LSMS is called "Firth", which is, to an extent, based on the
        <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Forth_(programming_language)">Forth</a> programming language. Similar to
        Forth, Firth mainly uses a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Reverse_Polish_notation">Reverse Polish notation</a>
        style of syntax, and the concept of an implicit stack.
    </p>

    <p>
        It is recommended that a Firth compiler is provided with implementations of the LMSM, to show how a high-level
        programming language can compile down to LMSM assembly.
    </p>

    <h2>An Example Firth Program: Squaring A Number</h2>

    <p>
        Before we delve into the details of Firth, let's look at an example program, based on the <code>SQUARE</code>
        assembly program we looked at on the <a href="assembly.html">LMSM Assembly</a> page.  The Firth program
        that would compile down to this assembly looks like this:
    </p>

    <pre>
    get
    square()
    .

    def square()
      dup *
    end
    </pre>

    <p>
        This program probably looks a little strange to you, so let's go through it line by line.
    </p>

    <p>
        The first line, <code>get</code>, gets an integer from the user and pushes it onto the top of the value stack.
    </p>

    <p>
        The second line, <code>square()</code>, invokes the function <code>square</code>.  Note that the argument to
        the <code>square</code> function is passed <em>implicitly</em>, on the value stack.  A little crazy but
        this is how Forth and many stack-based programming languages work.
    </p>

    <p>
        The third line, <code>.</code>, prints the top of the stack out.
    </p>

    <p>
        Next comes the definition of the function <code>square()</code>.  Its body consists of a single line: <code>dup *</code>.
        These two "words" are the Firth way of saying "Duplicate the top of the value stack and then replace the top two
        values of the value stack with the result of multiplying them together."
    </p>

    <p>
        This is the "Reverse Polish notation" nature of Firth.  In a more traditional programming language, this
        calculation would look something like this:
    </p>

    <pre>
    def square(x)
      x * x
    end
    </pre>

    <p>
        In this code the multiplication operator uses <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Infix_notation">Infix notation</a>.
        Firth, instead, uses the RPN style, where you "push" values onto a stack and then apply operations to them.
    </p>

    <p>
        Note that there is no explicit <code>return</code> in the definition of the <code>square()</code>
        function.  There is actually support for the <code>return</code> keyword in Firth, but it isn't necessary here:
        the square value is computed by the body of the function and left on the value stack, so when the function returns
        the return value is where it should be.
    </p>

    <p>
        Kind of a hack, but it works, and this program will do what we want: ask the user for a number and then print
        the square of it.
    </p>

    <p>
        So that's a quick introduction to the Firth programming language. Now let's look at all the elements of
        the language in more detail.
    </p>

    <h2>Elements Of The Firth Programming Langauge</h2>

    <p>
        The Firth programming language consists of a set of <em>elements</em>.  Calling them "expressions" or "statements"
        in the traditional sense of those terms is a little misleading since values are stored on a stack, so we will
        stick with the term "element".
    </p>

    <h3>Basic Elements</h3>

    <p>Firth supports the following "basic" elements:</p>

    <table style="width: 100%">
        <thead>
        <tr>
            <th>
                Element
            </th>
            <th>
                Example
            </th>
            <th>
                Assembly
            </th>
        </tr>
        </thead>
        <tbody>
        <tr>
            <td>
                Numbers
            </td>
            <td>
                <code>3</code>
            </td>
            <td>
                <code>LDI 3 SPUSH</code>
            </td>
        </tr>
        <tr>
            <td>
                Plus
            </td>
            <td>
                <code>2 3 +</code>
            </td>
            <td>
                <code>LDI 2 SPUSH LDI 3 SPUSH SADD</code>
            </td>
        </tr>
        <tr>
            <td>
                Minus
            </td>
            <td>
                <code>2 3 -</code>
            </td>
            <td>
                <code>LDI 2 SPUSH LDI 3 SPUSH SSUB</code>
            </td>
        </tr>
        <tr>
            <td>
                Multiplication
            </td>
            <td>
                <code>2 3 *</code>
            </td>
            <td>
                <code>LDI 2 SPUSH LDI 3 SPUSH SMUL</code>
            </td>
        </tr>
        <tr>
            <td>
                Division
            </td>

                <code>LDI 2 SPUSH LDI 3 SPUSH SDIV</code>
            </td>
        </tr>
        <tr>
            <td>
                Maximum
            </td>
            <td>
                <code>2 3 max</code>
            </td>
            <td>
                <code>LDI 2 SPUSH LDI 3 SPUSH SMAX</code>
            </td>
        </tr>
        <tr>
            <td>
                Minimum
            </td>
            <td>
                <code>2 3 min</code>
            </td>
            <td>
                <code>LDI 2 SPUSH LDI 3 SPUSH SMIN</code>
            </td>
        </tr>
        </tbody>
    </table>

    <h3>Stack Elements</h3>

    <p>Firth supports the following elements to operate on the value stack:</p>

    <table style="width: 100%">
        <thead>
        <tr>
            <th>
                Element
            </th>
            <th>
                Example
            </th>
            <th>
                Assembly
            </th>
        </tr>
        </thead>
        <tbody>
        <tr>
            <td>
                Pop The Top Of The Stack
            </td>
            <td>
                <code>pop</code>
            </td>
            <td>
                <code>SPOP</code>
            </td>
        </tr>
        <tr>
            <td>
                Duplicate Top Of Stack
            </td>
            <td>
                <code>dup</code>
            </td>
            <td>
                <code>SDUP</code>
            </td>
        </tr>
        <tr>
            <td>
                Swap The Top Two Elements On The Stack
            </td>
            <td>
                <code>swap</code>
            </td>
            <td>
                <code>SSWAP</code>
            </td>
        </tr>
        <tr>
            <td>
                Drop The Top Element Of The Stack
            </td>
            <td>
                <code>drop</code>
            </td>
            <td>
                <code>SDROP</code>
            </td>
        </tr>
        </tbody>
    </table>

    <p>
        The difference between <code>pop</code> and <code>drop</code> is that <code>pop</code> leaves the top value
        of the stack in the accumulator, whereas <code>drop</code> does not.
    </p>

    <h3>I/O</h3>

    <p>Firth supports the following elements for IO:</p>

    <table style="width: 100%">
        <thead>
        <tr>
            <th>
                Element
            </th>
            <th>
                Example
            </th>
            <th>
                Assembly
            </th>
        </tr>
        </thead>
        <tbody>
        <tr>
            <td>
                Get
            </td>
            <td>
                <code>get</code>
            </td>
            <td>
                <code>INP SPUSH</code>
            </td>
        </tr>
        <tr>
            <td>
                Print
            </td>
            <td>
                <code>.</code>
            </td>
            <td>
                <code>SDUP POP OUT</code>
            </td>
        </tr>
        </tbody>
    </table>

    <h3>Conditional Elements</h3>

    <p>
        Firth supports two conditional statements: <code>zero?</code> and <code>positive?</code>.  These elements
        consume the top of the stack.  If the condition is true of the top of the stack, they execute the elements in
        their body, which is terminated by an <code>end</code> keyword.
    </p>

    <p>
        If the condition is not true, the elements will execute an optional <code>else</code> block, if it is included,
        otherwise they will do nothing.
    </p>

    <p>
        Here is a simple "inverter" example Firth program that asks the user for some input and then prints
        <code>1</code> if the user enter<code>0</code> and <code>1</code> otherwise.
    </p>
    <pre>
  get
  zero?
    1
  else
    0
  end
  .
    </pre>

    <h3>The Loop Element</h3>

    <p>
        Firth supports a simple loop that starts with the <code>do</code> keyword and ends with the <code>loop</code>
        keyword.  A loop can be exited with the <code>stop</code> keyword.
    </p>

    <p>
        Here is an example of a loop that runs until the user enters a zero value:
    </p>

    <pre>
  do
    get
    zero?
      stop
    end
  loop
    </pre>

    <h3>Global Variables</h3>

    <p>
        Firth supports global variables.  They can be declared using the <code>var</code> keyword:
    </p>

    <code>
  var x
    </code>

    <p>
        Variables can be set by appending an exclamation point to their name.  This will consume the top of the stack
        and set the variable to the value.  The following program declares a variable <code>x</code>, saves user input
        into it, multiplies the variable by itself and then prints the result:
    </p>

    <pre>
        var x
        get
        x!
        x x *
        .
    </pre>

    <p>Variables must be declared first in Firth programs, and are global.  They cannot be declared within functions,
    loops or conditionals.</p>

    <h3>Functions</h3>

    <p>
        Functions can be declared using the <code>def</code> keyword, followed by a function name.  All function names
        must end in the characters <code>()</code>.  Note that you cannot declare parameters for a function: they
        are passed implicitly on the stack.
    </p>

    <p>
        The implementation of the function consists of a series of elements, followed by the keyword <code>end</code>:
    </p>

    <pre>
  def square()
    dup *
  end
    </pre>

    <p>
        Functions can return to a caller by using the <code>return</code> element.  The <code>return</code> element
        is optional: a function will implicitly return when its body completes.
    </p>

    <p>
        Note that functions in Firth can call themselves recursively.
    </p>

    <h3>Inline Assembly</h3>

    <p>
        LMSM assembly can be included in a Firth program by using the <code>asm</code> keyword, followed by the
        <code>end</code> keyword.
    </p>

    <p>
        Here is some Firth code that uses raw assembly to print out the value stored in the accumulator:
    </p>

    <pre>
  get
  pop
  asm
    OUT
  end
    </pre>

    <h2>Fibbonacci.firth</h2>

    <p>
        Below is a recursive implementation of the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fibonacci_number">fibonacci</a>
        algorithm in Firth:
    </p>

    <pre>
get
fib()
.

def fib()

  dup
  zero?
    return
  end

  dup 1 -
  zero?
    return
  end

  dup 2 -
  fib()

  swap 1 -
  fib()

  +
end
    </pre>
